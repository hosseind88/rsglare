A rsglare that I wrote in rust

### Quickstart:

First, you'll need to have [cargo](https://rustup.rs/) installed. Then you can
clone the repository and run the rsglare:

    cd rsglare/app
    cargo run --release scenes/test.json out.png

You can modify the rendered scene by editing test.json. Enjoy!
